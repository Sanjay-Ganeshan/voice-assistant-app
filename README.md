All the code for this project was generated by GPT-4, with occasional interference by humans / boilerplate generators.

GPT-4 also wrote the rest of the README below (with one or two minor edits).

# Voice Assistant App
This project is a simple voice assistant app built with React that allows users to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model using their voice. The app records the user's voice, transcribes it using the OpenAI API, and then sends the transcribed text to GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate a response. Finally, the response is read out loud using the browser's text-to-speech capabilities.

# Features
Record your voice using the browser's built-in microphone access
Transcribe your voice input using OpenAI's Whisper ASR API
Interact with OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model for generating responses
Play the generated response using the browser's text-to-speech feature
Store the OpenAI API key in session storage for easy access across sessions
