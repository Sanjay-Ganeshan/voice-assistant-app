# Human
what is the create-react-app command for typescript templates?

# GPT-4
To create a new React project with TypeScript using create-react-app, you can use the --template flag followed by typescript. Run the following command in your terminal:

lua
Copy code
npx create-react-app your-project-name --template typescript
Replace your-project-name with the desired name for your project. This will create a new React project using the TypeScript template, which comes preconfigured with TypeScript support and the necessary dependencies.

# Human
Here's my code:

import React, { Component } from 'react'

type Props = {}

type State = {}

export default class MainPage extends Component<Props, State> {
  state = {}

  render() {
    return (
      <div>MainPage</div>
    )
  }
}


Modify this component so that it displays a bright-red record button in the middle

# GPT-4
To modify your component to display a bright-red record button in the middle, you can add some inline CSS to style the button. Here's the updated code:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { Component } from 'react';

type Props = {};

type State = {};

export default class MainPage extends Component<Props, State> {
  state = {};

  render() {
    const buttonStyle = {
      display: 'flex',
      justifyContent: 'center',
      alignItems: 'center',
      position: 'absolute',
      top: '50%',
      left: '50%',
      transform: 'translate(-50%, -50%)',
      backgroundColor: 'red',
      borderRadius: '50%',
      width: '100px',
      height: '100px',
      color: 'white',
      fontSize: '1.5rem',
      border: 'none',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    };

    return (
      <div>
        <button style={buttonStyle}>⏺️</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
In this code snippet, I've created a buttonStyle object that contains CSS properties for styling the button. Then, I've added a <button> element inside the <div> with the style attribute set to buttonStyle. The button displays a red circle with the Unicode character "⏺️" (record button symbol) in the center.

# Human
That produced this error:
Type '{ display: string; justifyContent: string; alignItems: string; position: string; top: string; left: string; transform: string; backgroundColor: string; borderRadius: string; width: string; height: string; color: string; fontSize: string; border: string; cursor: string; }' is not assignable to type 'Properties<string | number, string & {}>'.
  Types of property 'position' are incompatible.
    Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Position | undefined'

# GPT-4
I apologize for the oversight. The issue is due to TypeScript's strict type checking for CSS properties. You can create a CSS file and import it to style your component instead of using inline styles.

First, create a new file named MainPage.module.css in the same directory as your MainPage component:

css
Copy code
/* MainPage.module.css */
.container {
  position: fixed;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

.recordButton {
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  color: white;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
Then, modify your MainPage component to import and use the CSS module:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import styles from './MainPage.module.css';

type Props = {};

type State = {};

export default class MainPage extends Component<Props, State> {
  state = {};

  render() {
    return (
      <div className={styles.container}>
        <button className={styles.recordButton}>⏺️</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
This approach moves the styles to a separate CSS file and utilizes CSS modules to prevent any type issues with TypeScript.

# Human
Change the button text to say "Record", and give it an animation on hover and click

# GPT-4
To change the button text to "Record" and add animations on hover and click, you can update your CSS file and add the appropriate styles.

Update your MainPage.module.css file:

css
Copy code
/* MainPage.module.css */
.container {
  position: fixed;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

.recordButton {
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  color: white;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  transition: transform 0.2s;
}

.recordButton:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}

.recordButton:active {
  transform: scale(0.9);
}
I've updated the recordButton class to use flexbox for centering the text, and added :hover and :active states for animations. The button now scales up by 10% when hovered and scales down by 10% when clicked.

Then, update your MainPage component to change the button text:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import styles from './MainPage.module.css';

type Props = {};

type State = {};

export default class MainPage extends Component<Props, State> {
  state = {};

  render() {
    return (
      <div className={styles.container}>
        <button className={styles.recordButton}>Record</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
Now, the button will display the text "Record" and have animations on hover and click.

# Human
Implement an onclick handler for the record button. When clicked, it should record the user's voice until the button is clicked again

# GPT-4
To implement the onclick handler for the record button, you need to use the MediaRecorder API to record the user's voice. The following code demonstrates how to create an onclick handler and toggle recording based on the button click:

Update the MainPage component:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import styles from './MainPage.module.css';

type Props = {};

type State = {
  isRecording: boolean;
  mediaRecorder: MediaRecorder | null;
};

export default class MainPage extends Component<Props, State> {
  state: State = {
    isRecording: false,
    mediaRecorder: null,
  };

  toggleRecording = async () => {
    const { isRecording, mediaRecorder } = this.state;

    if (!isRecording) {
      // Request audio recording permissions
      const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });

      // Create a new MediaRecorder instance and set it to the state
      const newMediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
      newMediaRecorder.start();

      newMediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (e) => {
        // Handle the recorded audio data (e.g., save it or send it to a server)
        console.log(e.data);
      };

      this.setState({ mediaRecorder: newMediaRecorder, isRecording: true });
    } else {
      // Stop the MediaRecorder and reset the state
      if (mediaRecorder) {
        mediaRecorder.stop();
        this.setState({ mediaRecorder: null, isRecording: false });
      }
    }
  };

  render() {
    const { isRecording } = this.state;

    return (
      <div className={styles.container}>
        <button className={styles.recordButton} onClick={this.toggleRecording}>
          {isRecording ? 'Stop' : 'Record'}
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
This code adds a toggleRecording method, which handles the recording process. When the button is clicked, and isRecording is false, it requests the user's permission to access the microphone, creates a new MediaRecorder instance, and starts recording.

When the button is clicked again (i.e., isRecording is true), the recording stops, and the recorded audio data is available in the ondataavailable event listener. Currently, the data is logged to the console, but you can save it or send it to a server.

The button text will also change depending on whether the recording is in progress or not.

# GPT-4
To call the speech-to-text API with the voice recording, you need to make some changes to your code. First, you'll want to create a function to send the audio data to the API. Next, you'll need to update the toggleRecording method to call this function with the recorded audio.

Install the axios library to make HTTP requests:
bash
Copy code
npm install axios
Update the MainPage component:
jsx
Copy code
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import styles from './MainPage.module.css';

type Props = {};

type State = {
  isRecording: boolean;
  mediaRecorder: MediaRecorder | null;
};

const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key_here';

export default class MainPage extends Component<Props, State> {
  state: State = {
    isRecording: false,
    mediaRecorder: null,
  };

  sendAudioToApi = async (audioBlob: Blob) => {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', audioBlob, 'audio.webm');
    formData.append('model', 'whisper-1');

    try {
      const response = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions', formData, {
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
          Authorization: `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
        },
      });

      console.log(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error sending audio to API:', error);
    }
  };

  toggleRecording = async () => {
    const { isRecording, mediaRecorder } = this.state;

    if (!isRecording) {
      const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
      const newMediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
      newMediaRecorder.start();

      newMediaRecorder.ondataavailable = async (e) => {
        await this.sendAudioToApi(e.data);
      };

      this.setState({ mediaRecorder: newMediaRecorder, isRecording: true });
    } else {
      if (mediaRecorder) {
        mediaRecorder.stop();
        this.setState({ mediaRecorder: null, isRecording: false });
      }
    }
  };

  render() {
    const { isRecording } = this.state;

    return (
      <div className={styles.container}>
        <button className={styles.recordButton} onClick={this.toggleRecording}>
          {isRecording ? 'Stop' : 'Record'}
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual API key.

In this updated component, I've added a new method sendAudioToApi, which takes an audio blob as an argument, creates a FormData object, and sends it as a POST request to the OpenAI API for transcription. The toggleRecording method now calls sendAudioToApi with the recorded audio data when the ondataavailable event is triggered.

Please note that this code assumes that the API key and endpoint are both correct and working. You might need to adjust them based on the actual API documentation and your API key. Additionally, be aware that exposing your API key in the frontend code is not secure. In a production environment, you should send the audio data to your backend server, which then makes the request to the API using the API key. This prevents exposing your API key to end users.

# Human

Here's another doc, describing an API for chat completion.
Modify the app such that when the transcription is available, it's send as a user message to the chat completion API, and we log the completed chat.


Using the OpenAI Chat API, you can build your own applications with gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 to do things like:

Draft an email or other piece of writing
Write Python code
Answer questions about a set of documents
Create conversational agents
Give your software a natural language interface
Tutor in a range of subjects
Translate languages
Simulate characters for video games and much more
This guide explains how to make an API call for chat-based language models and shares tips for getting good results. You can also experiment with the new chat format in the OpenAI Playground.

Introduction
Chat models take a series of messages as input, and return a model-generated message as output.

Although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn conversations easy, it’s just as useful for single-turn tasks without any conversations (such as those previously served by instruction following models like text-davinci-003).

An example API call looks as follows:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

11
12
# Note: you need to be using OpenAI Python v0.27.0 for the code below to work
import openai

openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
    ]
)
The main input is the messages parameter. Messages must be an array of message objects, where each object has a role (either "system", "user", or "assistant") and content (the content of the message). Conversations can be as short as 1 message or fill many pages.

Typically, a conversation is formatted with a system message first, followed by alternating user and assistant messages.

The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. In the example above, the assistant was instructed with "You are a helpful assistant."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 does not always pay strong attention to system messages. Future models will be trained to pay stronger attention to system messages.
The user messages help instruct the assistant. They can be generated by the end users of an application, or set by a developer as an instruction.

The assistant messages help store prior responses. They can also be written by a developer to help give examples of desired behavior.

Including the conversation history helps when user instructions refer to prior messages. In the example above, the user’s final question of "Where was it played?" only makes sense in the context of the prior messages about the World Series of 2020. Because the models have no memory of past requests, all relevant information must be supplied via the conversation. If a conversation cannot fit within the model’s token limit, it will need to be shortened in some way.

Response format
An example API response looks as follows:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13

 'id': 'chatcmpl-6p9XYPYSTTRi0xEviKjjilqrWU2Ve',
 'object': 'chat.completion',
 'created': 1677649420,
 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 56, 'completion_tokens': 31, 'total_tokens': 87},
 'choices': [
   {
    'message': {
      'role': 'assistant',
      'content': 'The 2020 World Series was played in Arlington, Texas at the Globe Life Field, which was the new home stadium for the Texas Rangers.'},
    'finish_reason': 'stop',
    'index': 0
   }
  ]
}
In Python, the assistant’s reply can be extracted with response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].

Every response will include a finish_reason. The possible values for finish_reason are:

stop: API returned complete model output
length: Incomplete model output due to max_tokens parameter or token limit
content_filter: Omitted content due to a flag from our content filters
null: API response still in progress or incomplete
Managing tokens
Language models read text in chunks called tokens. In English, a token can be as short as one character or as long as one word (e.g., a or apple), and in some languages tokens can be even shorter than one character or even longer than one word.

For example, the string "ChatGPT is great!" is encoded into six tokens: ["Chat", "G", "PT", " is", " great", "!"].

The total number of tokens in an API call affects:

How much your API call costs, as you pay per token
How long your API call takes, as writing more tokens takes more time
Whether your API call works at all, as total tokens must be below the model’s maximum limit (4096 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo-0301)
Both input and output tokens count toward these quantities. For example, if your API call used 10 tokens in the message input and you received 20 tokens in the message output, you would be billed for 30 tokens.

To see how many tokens are used by an API call, check the usage field in the API response (e.g., response['usage']['total_tokens']).

Chat models like gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 use tokens in the same way as other models, but because of their message-based formatting, it's more difficult to count how many tokens will be used by a conversation.

DEEP DIVE
Counting tokens for chat API calls
To see how many tokens are in a text string without making an API call, use OpenAI’s tiktoken Python library. Example code can be found in the OpenAI Cookbook’s guide on how to count tokens with tiktoken.

Each message passed to the API consumes the number of tokens in the content, role, and other fields, plus a few extra for behind-the-scenes formatting. This may change slightly in the future.

If a conversation has too many tokens to fit within a model’s maximum limit (e.g., more than 4096 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo), you will have to truncate, omit, or otherwise shrink your text until it fits. Beware that if a message is removed from the messages input, the model will lose all knowledge of it.

Note too that very long conversations are more likely to receive incomplete replies. For example, a gpt-3.5-turbo conversation that is 4090 tokens long will have its reply cut off after just 6 tokens.

Instructing chat models
Best practices for instructing models may change from model version to version. The advice that follows applies to gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 and may not apply to future models.

Many conversations begin with a system message to gently instruct the assistant. For example, here is one of the system messages used for ChatGPT:

You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. Answer as concisely as possible. Knowledge cutoff: {knowledge_cutoff} Current date: {current_date}

In general, gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 does not pay strong attention to the system message, and therefore important instructions are often better placed in a user message.

If the model isn’t generating the output you want, feel free to iterate and experiment with potential improvements. You can try approaches like:

Make your instruction more explicit
Specify the format you want the answer in
Ask the model to think step by step or debate pros and cons before settling on an answer
For more prompt engineering ideas, read the OpenAI Cookbook guide on techniques to improve reliability.

Beyond the system message, the temperature and max tokens are two of many options developers have to influence the output of the chat models. For temperature, higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. In the case of max tokens, if you want to limit a response to a certain length, max tokens can be set to an arbitrary number. This may cause issues for example if you set the max tokens value to 5 since the output will be cut-off and the result will not make sense to users.

Chat vs Completions
Because gpt-3.5-turbo performs at a similar capability to text-davinci-003 but at 10% the price per token, we recommend gpt-3.5-turbo for most use cases.

For many developers, the transition is as simple as rewriting and retesting a prompt.

For example, if you translated English to French with the following completions prompt:

Translate the following English text to French: "{text}"
An equivalent chat conversation could look like:

1
2
3
4
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."},
  {"role": "user", "content": 'Translate the following English text to French: "{text}"'}
]
Or even just the user message:

1
2
3
[
  {"role": "user", "content": 'Translate the following English text to French: 


# GPT-4

To update the click handler to call the speech-to-text API and then send the transcription as a user message to the chat completion API, you can modify the code as follows:

First, make sure to import the necessary libraries:

javascript
Copy code
import openai from 'openai';
Then, update the click handler function:

javascript
Copy code
async function handleClick() {
  const audioFile = new Blob(chunks, { type: 'audio/mp3' });

  // Transcribe audio to text
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', audioFile);
  formData.append('model', 'whisper-1');

  const transcriptionResponse = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
    },
    body: formData,
  });

  const transcriptionData = await transcriptionResponse.json();
  const transcription = transcriptionData.text;

  // Send transcription as user message to chat completion API
  const chatResponse = await openai.ChatCompletion.create({
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
      { role: 'user', content: transcription },
    ],
  });

  // Log the completed chat
  console.log(chatResponse['choices'][0]['message']['content']);
}
This code updates the click handler function to first call the speech-to-text API with the voice recording, and then send the transcription as a user message to the chat completion API. Finally, it logs the completed chat. Make sure to replace OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual API key.

# Human
Rewrite this, but don't import openai. Send an HTTP request with axios instead.

# GPT-4
First, make sure you have the axios library installed. You can install it using:

Copy code
npm install axios
Then, update the click handler function using axios:

javascript
Copy code
import axios from 'axios';

async function handleClick() {
  const audioFile = new Blob(chunks, { type: 'audio/mp3' });

  // Transcribe audio to text
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', audioFile);
  formData.append('model', 'whisper-1');

  const transcriptionResponse = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions', formData, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
    },
  });

  const transcription = transcriptionResponse.data.text;

  // Send transcription as user message to chat completion API
  const chatResponse = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
      { role: 'user', content: transcription },
    ],
  }, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });

  // Log the completed chat
  console.log(chatResponse.data.choices[0].message.content);
}
In this updated code, I've replaced the OpenAI library with axios for sending HTTP requests. The transcription and chat completion API calls are now both done using axios.post. Make sure to replace OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual API key.

# Human
Instead of logging the completed chat, read it out using text-to-speech

# GPT-4

To read the completed chat using the browser's built-in text-to-speech API, you can use the SpeechSynthesis API. Update the handleClick function like this:

javascript
Copy code
import axios from 'axios';

async function handleClick() {
  const audioFile = new Blob(chunks, { type: 'audio/mp3' });

  // Transcribe audio to text
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', audioFile);
  formData.append('model', 'whisper-1');

  const transcriptionResponse = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions', formData, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
    },
  });

  const transcription = transcriptionResponse.data.text;

  // Send transcription as user message to chat completion API
  const chatResponse = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
      { role: 'user', content: transcription },

When I load the website on my phone, the record button doesn't work. Why?

# GPT-4
The issue could be related to the specific browser or device you're using, as some mobile browsers may have different permissions or limitations for accessing the microphone or certain APIs. Here are a few things you can check:

Permissions: Make sure that your browser has permission to access the microphone. You might need to check the browser settings or the device's settings to grant access.

Browser compatibility: Ensure that you are using a modern browser that supports the required APIs (MediaRecorder, getUserMedia, etc.). Some older browsers or less common mobile browsers may not fully support these APIs. Consider using a popular browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

Autoplay policy: Some mobile browsers have strict autoplay policies that can prevent audio playback without user interaction. You can try adding a button to your web page that triggers the text-to-speech playback when clicked, as this might resolve the autoplay issue.

Device-specific issues: It's possible that there may be device-specific issues causing the problem. In this case, testing the website on different devices and browsers can help identify the cause.

Debugging: Check the browser's developer console for any error messages or warnings that may be related to the issue. You can usually access the console on mobile devices through the browser's developer options or by connecting the device to a computer and using remote debugging tools.

If you're still experiencing issues, please provide more information about the device, browser, and any error messages or specific behavior you're encountering, so that I can provide more targeted assistance.

I want to save a string in Session Storage, in typescript. How do I do this?

# GPT-4
In TypeScript, you can use the sessionStorage object to store data temporarily in the browser's session. Here's an example of how to save a string in sessionStorage:

typescript
Copy code
// Save a string to sessionStorage
function saveString(key: string, value: string): void {
  sessionStorage.setItem(key, value);
}

// Example usage
const myKey = "exampleKey";
const myValue = "This is an example string.";

saveString(myKey, myValue);
In this example, we have a function called saveString that accepts a key and a value as arguments. It uses the setItem method to store the value with the specified key in sessionStorage. The stored data will be available for the duration of the page session and will be deleted when the browser window or tab is closed.

What's the type of ev?

# GPT-4
The type of ev in the textChanged method is React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>. This type represents a change event for an input element in a React application.

Here's how you can update the textChanged method with the correct event type:

typescript
Copy code
textChanged(ev: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    // Your code here
}
Now, you can access the value of the input element using ev.target.value within the textChanged method.

# Human
I want the text box to be updated normally when the text is changed. How do I do this?

# GPT-4
To update the text box when the text is changed, you can maintain the input value in the component's state and update it in the textChanged method. Here's how you can do this:

Add a new state property for the input value:
typescript
Copy code
type State = {
    isRecording: boolean;
    apiKey: string;
    mediaRecorder: MediaRecorder | null;
    inputValue: string; // Add this line
};
Initialize the new state property in the state object:
typescript
Copy code
state: State = {
    isRecording: false,
    mediaRecorder: null,
    inputValue: '', // Add this line
};
Update the textChanged method to set the new input value:
typescript
Copy code
textChanged(ev: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    this.setState({ inputValue: ev.target.value });
}
Bind the input value to the state in the render method:
typescript
Copy code
<input type="text" value={this.state.inputValue} onChange={this.textChanged.bind(this)} />
Now, the text box will be updated normally when the text is changed, and the updated value will be stored in the component's state.

typescript
Copy code
saveToken(ev: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    // Your code here
}
This type will give you access to the event properties and methods specific to focus events for input elements.

I'm hosting my app on S3 as a website. How can I redirect all traffic to HTTPS instead of HTTP?

# GPT-4
To redirect all traffic from HTTP to HTTPS when hosting your app on Amazon S3, you'll need to use Amazon CloudFront along with an SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Here's a step-by-step guide:

Create an SSL certificate:

Go to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console.
Click "Request a certificate" and follow the steps to create an SSL certificate for your domain. Make sure you create the certificate in the same region as your CloudFront distribution will be.
Complete the domain validation process.
Create a CloudFront distribution:

Go to the AWS CloudFront console.
Click "Create Distribution."
Choose "Web" as the delivery method.
In the "Origin Settings" section:
For "Origin Domain Name," select your S3 bucket from the list or enter the S3 website endpoint.
Set "Origin Protocol Policy" to "HTTP Only."
In the "Default Cache Behavior Settings" section:
Set "Viewer Protocol Policy" to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS."
In the "Distribution Settings" section:
Add your domain name to "Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)."
For "SSL Certificate," choose "Custom SSL Certificate" and select the SSL certificate you created in ACM.
Click "Create Distribution."
Update your DNS settings:

Go to your DNS provider's console (e.g., Route 53, GoDaddy, etc.).
Update your domain's DNS settings to point to the CloudFront distribution's domain name (e.g., d12345abcdexample.cloudfront.net). This usually involves creating or updating a CNAME or A record with an alias.
Now, all traffic to your domain should be redirected to HTTPS. It may take some time for the DNS changes to propagate and the CloudFront distribution to become active.

# GPT-4
Voice Assistant App
This project is a simple voice assistant app built with React that allows users to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model using their voice. The app records the user's voice, transcribes it using the OpenAI API, and then sends the transcribed text to GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate a response.
